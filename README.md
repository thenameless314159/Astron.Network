# Astron.Network [![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Astron.Network)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Astron.Network/)

This project is based on [**SimplPipelines**](https://github.com/mgravell/simplsockets), also this project was priorly made by [*Dr.Brooklyn*](https://github.com/DrBrooklyn/), I basically just unit-tested the whole thing and finished/cleaned the almost done library.

The main goal of this project is to provide an easily extandable and scalable network, therefore a framing logic has been provided in order to handle any types of protocol you would want to handle.
